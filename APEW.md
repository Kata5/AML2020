Domain: Neuroscience (bio)

Motivation: Model and analyse the effect of motion on 2photon Ca data of free behaving mice with factor analysis and auto encoders. 

Methods: factor analysis. Activity in latent space should be regressed to locomotion speed. If I have time, variational autoencoders will be also used.
(I have not used any ML methods on this data yet. )

Data: Either from Allen Brain Institude data: https://allensdk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ or own data. Update: Own data is provided.

State of the art papers: 
-Amelia J. Christensen, Jonathan W. Pillow, Running reduces firing but improves coding in rodent higherorder visual cortex


Time: the entire semester
