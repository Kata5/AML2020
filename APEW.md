Project plan 1.) 

Behavioural segmentation + motion detection + effect of motion on data from Allen Brain Institude data: https://allensdk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
Maybe it I have time: finding active cells: with classic term frequency (TF)–inverse document frequency (IDF) search algorithm

State of the art papers: 
-Amelia J. Christensen, Jonathan W. Pillow, Running reduces firing but improves coding in rodent higherorder visual cortex
-Simon Musall, Matthew T. Kaufman, Ashley L. Juavinett, Steven Gluf1 and Anne K. Churchland: Single-trial neural dynamics are dominated by
richly varied movements


Project plan 2.) 

Cancer detection with Inception-ResNet-v2 on CARS images on unpublished own dataset (if allowed)
State of the art papers: 
Liu, Y. et al. Detecting cancer metastases on gigapixel pathology images.
