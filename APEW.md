Motivation: Model and analyse the effect of motion on 2photon Ca data of free behaving mice with factor analysis and auto encoders. 
Methods: factor analysis. Activity in latent space should be regressed to locomotion speed. If I have time, variational autoencoders will be also used.
Data: Either from Allen Brain Institude data: https://allensdk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ or own data
State of the art papers: 
-Amelia J. Christensen, Jonathan W. Pillow, Running reduces firing but improves coding in rodent higherorder visual cortex
-Simon Musall, Matthew T. Kaufman, Ashley L. Juavinett, Steven Gluf1 and Anne K. Churchland: Single-trial neural dynamics are dominated by
richly varied movements
